File I/O = input/output to and from files
-data needs to be stored somewhere when program is not running
- Ruby IO has the methods read, write, gets, puts, readline, getc, and printf (for example)
    - puts goes to the next line, print stays on the current line
aFile = File.new("filename","mode") -> cannot be associated with a block
aFile.close
F.open("filename","mode") do |aFile| asdfasdf; end -> creates new File object - can be associated with a block
content = aFile.sysread(20) -> reads first 20 characters of the file - pointer is placed at char. 21
aFile.syswrite("ABCDEF") -> writes "ABCDEF" into file
arr = IO.readlines("input.txt") -> reads files line by line
puts arr[0]
puts arr[1]
